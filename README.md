### Arduino Server
This project was made from aWOT software using an ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller and this tutorial from aWOT: https://awot.net/en/guide/tutorial.html#d2h-777323


### What it currently does
This can currently remotely toggle the Arduino's built-in LED via axios get and put calls onto a backend hosted by the microcontroller.

to use, follow the tutorial's npm installs and make sure you have C, C++, and arduino extentions for VScode. The arduino IDE is also a must because you must compile the arduino code to get it's IP address

### Currently being done
on the ryan branch, the server is being configured to include temperature, light, and humidity readings.

### Future Plans
TBD
